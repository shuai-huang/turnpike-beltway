# Solving the noisy turnpike and beltway problems
* The `turnpike` problem, also known as the `partial digest` problem, tries to reconstruct the locations of a set of points that lie on a **`line`** from their unassigned pairwise diatances.
* The `beltway` problem tries to reconstruct the locations of a set of points that lie on a **`loop`** from their unassigned pairwise diatances.

* This package contains code files to implement the approach described in the following paper.
